This file contains various hints for using pkgsrc on Fidelix

# Program XXX complains about missing certificates

The certificate bundle is not automatically generated by pkgsrc. Try running:

    mozilla-rootcerts install

# Package XXX complains about missing users/groups

Some packages require additional users and groups the script
`create-users-groups.sh` will create the users and groups for all the packages
provided by pkgsrc. Note that many systems may not need all of these groups; on
some setups it may be preferable to create only the necessary users and groups
by hand.

# Package XXX complains about missing python3 or python2

Some packages require the binaries `python3` and `python2` to exist. These are
not created by default, as it is left up to the system administrator which
version of Python to user for the default `python3` and `python2`. This can be
fixed by symlinking your preferred version of Python 3 to
`/usr/local/bin/python3` and likewise for Python 2.
