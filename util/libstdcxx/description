libstdcxx and libgcc shared objects from gcc

If gcc is installed, then this package is not necessary. It exists solely to
provide the libstdcxx.so and libgcc_s.so libraries independent of the gcc
package. This is necessary in order to run C++ applications without installing
the entire gcc package, which is something many systems may need (especially
for space conservation since the whole GCC package is 600MB+).
