BSD Tar archiving utility

This package contains bsdtar, a high-efficiency libarchive front-end which
is [almost] wholly compatible with the ubiquitous GNU tar.  It supports
advanced features many other implementations do not.

This package is not installed by default, and many systems will have no issues
using the BusyBox tar; however, BusyBox tar does not support extended file
system attributes (such as setcap binaries and xattrs). Support for these is
necessary when creating and extracting root filesystem tarballs so that system
files have the attributes they need to function properly and securely.
