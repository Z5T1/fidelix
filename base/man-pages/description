The Linux man-pages

The Linux man-pages project documents the Linux kernel and C library interfaces
that are employed by user-space programs. With respect to the C library, the
primary focus is the GNU C library (glibc), although, where known,
documentation of variations on other C libraries available for Linux is also
included. The project provides manual pages in the following sections:

    1: User commands; man-pages includes a very few Section 1 pages that
       document programs supplied by the GNU C library.
    2: System calls documents the system calls provided by the Linux kernel.
    3: Library functions documents the functions provided by the standard C
       library.
    4: Devices documents details of various devices, most of which reside in
       /dev.
    5: Files describes various file formats, and includes proc(5), which
       documents the /proc file system.
    7: Overviews, conventions, and miscellaneous.
    8: Superuser and system administration commands; man-pages includes a very
       few Section 8 pages that document programs supplied by the GNU C
       library.
