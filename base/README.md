Base Package Group
==================

This package group contains the basic userspace packages. The base package
group is entirely self hosted: that is, it is capable of recompiling and
rebootstrapping itself.

In order to keep the system lean and lightweight, only packages that are
necessary for the base system and the kernel to compile are included in this
group.
