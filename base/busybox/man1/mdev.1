.SH NAME
mdev \- manual page for mdev 1.31.1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mdev
[\fI\,-s\/\fR] \fI\,| \/\fR[\fI\,-df\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BusyBox v1.31.1 (2020\-04\-30 13:38:01 EDT) multi\-call binary.
.PP
mdev \fB\-s\fR is to be run during boot to scan \fI\,/sys\/\fP and populate \fI\,/dev\/\fP.
mdev \fB\-d[f]\fR: daemon, listen on netlink.
.HP
\fB\-f\fR: stay in foreground.
.SS "Bare mdev is a kernel hotplug helper. To activate it:"
.IP
echo \fI\,/sbin/mdev\/\fP >/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
.PP
It uses \fI\,/etc/mdev.conf\/\fP with lines
.IP
[\-][ENV=regex;]...DEVNAME UID:GID PERM [>|=PATH]|[!] [@|$|*PROG]
.PP
where DEVNAME is device name regex, @major,minor[\-minor2], or
environment variable regex. A common use of the latter is
to load modules for hotplugged devices:
.IP
$MODALIAS=.* 0:0 660 @modprobe "$MODALIAS"
.PP
If \fI\,/dev/mdev.seq\/\fP file exists, mdev will wait for its value
to match $SEQNUM variable. This prevents plug/unplug races.
To activate this feature, create empty \fI\,/dev/mdev.seq\/\fP at boot.
.PP
If \fI\,/dev/mdev.log\/\fP file exists, debug log will be appended to it.
