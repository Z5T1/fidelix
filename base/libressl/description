LibreSSL Crytography Library

LibreSSL is a version of the TLS/crypto stack forked from OpenSSL in 2014, with
goals of modernizing the codebase, improving security, and applying best
practice development processes. 

Primary development occurs inside the OpenBSD source tree with the usual care
the project is known for. On a regular basis the code is re-packaged for
portable use by other operating systems.
