Fidelix Installation Guide
================================================================================

There are several different ways Fidelix can be installed. A few of these are
documented below.

# Bootstrapping from an Existing Linux Distribution

This method of installation is very similar to
[Automated Linux from Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/). It
starts by building a bootstrap system and then using that inside a chroot to
build the system. A big advantage of this method is that it allows for Fidelix
to be built and installed from a different distribution.

Documentation for this method can be found in bootstrap/tools/README.md
